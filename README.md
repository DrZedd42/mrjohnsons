Bounty board for a Shadowrun campaing.

Web application written in NodeJS that will take the appearance of the website of a character in a Shadowrun campaign I'm DMing. The application will have a run generator and a bounty board for players to select the missions they want to run and create a more immersive experience.

The application also serves as a playground to test web development techniques and technologies.
